## H2 Heading

### H3 Heading

Here's some basic text.

And here's some *italics*

Here's some **bold** text.

What about a [link] (https://github.com)

Here's a bulleted list:
* First item
+ Second item
- Third item

Here's a numbered list:
1. First
2. Second
3. Third

Python code block:
```python
    import numpy as np

    def test_function(x,y):
      z=np.sum(x,y)
      return z
```

R code block:
```r
library(tidyverse)
df<-read_csv("sundata.csv")
head(df)
```

Here's some inline code 'x+y'.

Here's an image:
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Background-02.png" alt="K-means clustering">

Here's some math:

$$z=x+y$$

You can also put it inline $$z=x+y$$
